    <h2>CAD</h2>
    <p>The first step in 3D printing is CAD. CAD is where you design the 3D model of the object that you want to
        print. I personally use <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal">Fusion360</a>, which is free if you don't use it to make money, although there are many
        other programs from which you can design 3D models, such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> which is free.

    <h2>Printer Types</h2>
    <p>FDM is the most popular and well known type of 3D printing, it makes objects by
        applying layer after layer of heated plastic that is extruded in a thin stream from a nozzle. This is the cheapest and
        most common type of 3D printing, and filaments for it are widely available. It does however, have a slow print speed,
        and it is limited in precision due to the minimum width of the nozzle and filament.

    <h2>Filament Types</h2>
    <p>There are many types of filaments for FDM 3D printing, in many types of plastics and colors. Filament comes on a spool
        and is unwound and melted by the printer, and extruded. The most common, and easiest to work with is PLA (polylactic acid).
        PLA comes in many colors, works in a fairly wide range of temperatures, is durable and strong, although not very flexible.
        Other common types of filaments include: ABS, PET, and Nylon, each with it's own unique properties and strengths.
